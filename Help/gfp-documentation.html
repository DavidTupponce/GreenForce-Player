				<h2>Introduction <a name="introduction"></a></h2>
				<p>GreenForce-Player is a portable alternative media player, with many additional features.
				One of these features is to protect media files.
				You can encrypt your audio and video files with a password and protect them against screenshots.
				An other nice feature is the coverflow. It allows you to start playback by clicking on the cover of your favorite music. 
				Last but not least, there is a cache system. It is used to reduce usage of your hard disc.
				The software has been developed for Windows. It was tested with Windows XP, Vista, 7 and 8.
				GFP is easy to install and use and ist therefore ideal for beginners. However, there are also advanced features for professional usage. It suits perfectly on USB sticks, because it is compact, portable and does not require an installations. You just need to copy one single executable with a size of 3.5MB on the stick (just GreenForce-Player.exe is required).

				<h2>Installation<a name="install"></a></h2>
				<p>The GreenForce-Player does not need an installation. It requires only the GreenForce-Player.exe.
				Therefore it is ideal for use on a portable media like an USB stick.
				The file extension &quot;.gfp&quot; will be registered automatically at the first start of the application. Additionally the protocol &quot;gfp://&quot; will be available to open media files directly from the browser (e.g. with an url like gfp://www.your-domain.tld/your-video.gfp). This allows streaming of media files via the HTTP protocol.
				Note that despite the name of the protocol it can be also used to stream unencrypted media files (e.g. gfp://www.your-domain.tld/your-video.wmv is also possible). Internally &quot;gfp://&quot; will be replaced by &quot;http://&quot;.
				There is also an Installer available which will create additional entries in the program menu and on the desktop.</p>

			<div class="textblock">
				<h2>Play a media file<a name="playmedia"></a></h2>
				<p>You can load media files with the menu item &quot;Load&quot; or you can use the Drag and Drop function.
				It is also possible to use playlists where you can load media files from. The video/audio will play automatically.
				The supported audio and video formats depend on installed codecs of the operating system. There is a build in support for .ogg and .flac files.
				</p>
			</div>

			<div class="textblock">
				<h2>Organize playlists<a name="organize_playlists"></a></h2>
				<p>To use a playlist choose the menu item &quot;Playlist&quot; in the menu &quot;Media&quot;.
				There are the following commands in the toolbar.</p><p>Playlists can be organized with the following functionality:</p>
				<div class="leftscreenshot">
					<ul>
						<li><img class="playlisticons" src="img/icon-playlist-add.png" alt="add playlist"/>Create a playlist</li>
						<li><img class="playlisticons" src="img/icon-playlist-remove.png" alt="remove playlist"/>Delete a playlist</li>
						<li><img class="playlisticons" src="img/icon-playlist-import.png" alt="import playlist"/>Import a complete playlist</li>
						<li><img class="playlisticons" src="img/icon-playlist-export.png" alt="export playlist"/>Export a complete playlist</li>
						<li><img class="playlisticons" src="img/icon-playlist-play.png" alt="play"/>Play the selected file of the active playlist</li>
					</ul>	
					<p>Media resources can be organized with the following functionality:</p>
					<ul>
						<li><img class="playlisticons" src="img/icon-file-media.png" alt="add file"/>add a file to the active playlist</li>
						<li><img class="playlisticons" src="img/icon-file-folder.png" alt="add folder"/>add a complete folder to the activ e playlist</li>
						<li><img class="playlisticons" src="img/icon-file-url.png" alt="add url"/>add a URL to the playlist</li>
						<li><img class="playlisticons" src="img/icon-file-remove.png" alt="remove file"/>remove a file from the playlist</li>

				<h2>Coverflow<a name="coverflow"></a></h2>
				<p>To use the coverflow&nbsp;choose the menu item &quot;Coverflow&quot; in the menu &quot;Media&quot;.
				<a href="#organize_playlists">You need a playlist to use it, because the coverflow shows all files from all playlists.</a>
				The coverflow has two different modes to presentation the covers &quot;2D&quot; and &quot;3D&quot;.</p>
			</div>

				<h2>Protect a media file<a name="protect_media"></a></h2>
				<div class="leftscreenshot">
					To protect a media file with a password choose the menu item &quot;Protect media&quot; in the menu &quot;DRM&quot;.
					You must set the password, source file (the media file which should be protected) and the destination file.
					For the password you can set a tip/hint to help you remembering your password.
					You can also set tags and a cover (.bmp, .jpg, .jp2, .png, .tga and .tiff) for your protected media file.
					By default password protected media files are protected against screenshots. All options regarding portection can be found on the tab &quot;Protection&quot;. 
					Beside the &quot;Disallow screenshots&quot; option there is an additional option to enforce screenshot protection. This can be done by deselecting the checkbox &quot;Not enforce screenshot protection&quot;. 
					Note that this could completly prevent playback of the media file if the operating system does not fit the requirements (e.g. old operating systems, virtual machines). But keep in mind that this will be no 100% solution to protect the content. It is still possible to make a photography of the monitor with a camera.
					Further possiblities are setting an expire date for the protected media file or allowing it to run only on a certain machine (possible by setting the &quot;Machine ID&quot; field).
					A really nifty option is to create a standalone EXE file which includes the player and the protected media file.
					To do this, you just need to check &quot;add player to the media file&quot;. The big advantage then is that you do not need to have GreenForce Player installed to play the protected media. All necessary files are directly included in the prtected file (however a codec is still required on the system).
					Creating a standalone EXE file also allows you to choose your own icon of the executable. The icon must be an .ico file. You can also additional command line parameters to your standalone executable (e.g. /fullscreen to start your protected media file in fullscreen mode). Just click on the &quot;?&quot; button to list possible parameters.
					If this sounds interesting to you also download the GreenForce Player SDK, there you will find an additional tools. The SDK includes a tool to automate crateion of .gfp files, a tool to create executables with can contain more than one media file in one executable and many more interesting tools.
