<h1>Protect video with password</h1>
<h2>Introduction</h2>
With GreenForce Player it is possible to protect multimedia files (video/ audio) files with a password. So the media file can be opened only if the correct password is provided. GreenForce Player uses its own container format, so it supports all multimedia formats (only a codec is required).
The big advantage over other encryption tools is that GreenForce Player can directly play the media form RAM without copying it to the hard disk. Also note that GreenForce Player does <b>not</b> need administrator rights to install and run.
<h2>Open media file in GreenForce Player</h2>

<p>First open the media you want to protect with GreenForce Player. Here we choose a short video with the name "racing-car.avi". However, GreenForce Player can encrypt all kinds of media files.</p>

				<h2>Enter password</h2>
				In the "Protect Video" dialog you can define the file name of the protected file. By default this is the original file name with ".gfp” as ending. To help you remembering the correct password you could also specify a tip which is shown in the password dialog when you try to open the media file. The only necessary step is to enter the password. All other steps we will describe later are optional.

				<h2>Protect the video against Screenshots</h2>
				One very interesting feature of GreenForce Player is the possibility to protect the content of your video. So you cannot make screenshots of it. However, please bear in mind that there is no 100% solution to do this and it is still possible to copy the video by filming the content of the monitor. To enable content protection just select the option "Active” instead of "Inactive”
				Here you can see what happens if we try to make a screenshot. With content protection enabled you will only get a black window:

		</td>		
	</tr>	
</table>

<h2>Tags</h2>
On the next tab you can set or change tags like "Title", "Album", "Interpret" and "Comments".
If your original video file already contains certain tags then GreenForce Player will automatically use them.

<h2>Add own cover</h2>
You can add an cover to your protected media file. This then will be shown if you add your protected media file to a playlist. GreenForce Player also uses a cover file from your original media file automatically if available.

<h2>Create a Standalone EXE file</h2>
to create a standalone Executable file, you just need to check "add player to the media file". The big advantage then is that you do not need to have GreenForce Player installed to play the protected media. All necessary files are directly included in the prtected file.

<h2>Finish</h2>
To finally encrypt the file just click on the "Save" button. The encryption process is very fast so it just takes a few seconds to finish.
<p><img src="images/password-protect-content-protection-encryption-prograssbar.jpg" alt="encryption progress"></img></p>
Now there should be an encrypted file in the destination folder. To open the file just double click on it in the explorer.	
If you do not want that the password dialog appears then you could also use the command line parameter "/password" to pass the password.

This is the easiest way to protect the file. However, you could also protect files with the <a href="GFP-Password-protect-video-with-crypt-tool.htm">Crypt tool</a>.
